I had made this project committee system where we can organinse the committees like (kitty party, etc)
in this the admin can create committee and the user can book for the particular committee
The admin and user can communicate in it.
This Project shares the common ui that is build in bootstrap5.

Take a clone of the project.
run command npm i in terminal for both frontend and backend (installation)
use npm start command for both frontend and backend in terminal to run the project
admin mail and password-- admin@gmail.com , password-- admin123
existing user mail and password-- mridul@gmail.com, password-- 123

tools-- postman-- to test the api
        visual studio-- for coding

** additionally i had used nodejs with mongodb database as a backend for the proper workflow.
